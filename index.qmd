## Background

::: {.incremental}
-   Why did they write this paper?
-   What was the need?
-   What did they hope to achieve?
-   What did they contribute to what is already known about categories of receptors?

## Method: <br> 1. Determine AP receptor affinities

<br/>


::: {.incremental} 

- Lit. search for AP receptor affinities; 
- Include receptor if data were available for ≤ 5 separate drugs; 
- Include AP if data were available for ≤ 5 separate receptors; 
- Remove receptors if Ki values were identical for all drugs. 

:::

---

## Method: <br>  2. Cluster APs based on receptor affinities 

::: {.incremental}

- Cluster AP into groups based on similar receptor profiles 
- Convert Ki values to pKi values and adjust for drugs that are agonists or partial agonists at a given receptor 
- Create correlation matrix with adjusted pKi values  
- Group AP with similar receptor profiles into distinct groups

:::

---
## Method: <br> 3. Characterise relationships <br> 

::: {.incremental}
 
- Characterise the receptor-defined clusters by receptor affinities and clinical profiles.
- Compare the ability of these clusters to predict side effects. 
- Compare results to existing methods of categorising APs.

## Results: Four groups were defined:



## Group 1

<br>

<br>

Muscarinic (M3-M5) receptor antagonism. Cholinergic and metabolic side effects.

## Group 2

<br>

<br>

Dopamine (D2) partial agonism and adrenergic antagonism. Globally low side effect burden.



## Group 3

<br>

<br>

Serotonergic and dopaminergic antagonism. Globally moderate side effect burden.



## Group 4

<br>

<br>

Dopaminergic antagonism; Extrapyramidal and motor side effects.



## Conclusion
Groups 1 and 4 were more efficacious than clusters 2 and 3. The novel classification was superior to existing approaches when predicting side effects


Conclusions: A receptor affinity-based grouping not only reflects compound pharmacology but also detects meaningful clinical differences to a greater extent than existing approaches. The approach has the potential to benefit both patients and researchers by guiding treatment and informing drug development.



## Discussion - How can we use this in our work?

The correlation matrix effectively normalises for D2 pKi thereby [**accounting for the dosing differences between AP**]{style="color:#cc0000"}. Mention that we could avoid using the conversion to chlorpromazine equivalencies - mention the work that Andrea did here.

(Has a similar effect to normalising for D2 pKi, thereby accounting for the dosing differences between AP - they cite their work - look at fig.3 [@Kaar.etal2020])
