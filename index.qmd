## Background for new classification system

::: incremental
-   Bridge the gap between clinical and research domains
-   Improve treatment response/tolerability when a medication switch is necessary
-   Clarify oversimplification (typical/atypical, 1st vs 2nd gen.)

## Method: Research-focused data

### Step 1: <br> Determine AP receptor affinities

<br>

::: incremental
-   Receptor affinities obtained from NIMH.
-   Include receptor if data were available for ≤ 5 separate drugs.
-   Include AP if data were available for ≤ 5 separate receptors.
-   Remove receptors if Ki values were identical for all drugs.

## Step 2: <br> 
### Cluster APs by receptor affinities

<br>

::: incremental
-   Adjust pKi values for agonists/partial agonists.
-   Create correlation matrix with adjusted pKi values.
-   Group AP with similar receptor profiles into distinct groups.

## Step 3: <br> 
### Characterize relationships 

<br>

::: incremental
-   Perform Probabilistic PCA of receptor profiles.
-   Calculate mean contribution of each AP cluster to PCs.
-   Compare the ability of these clusters to predict side effects using ML.
-   Compare results to existing methods of categorizing APs including NbN [@Zohar.etal2015].
-   Evaluate median absolute error for 27 APs.

## Method: Clinical profile data

-   Created a database of side effects

-   Reviewed 2060 citations

-   Meta-analyses RCT data

-   Compared effect sizes to placebo

-   Consensus statements/guidelines for missing side effect estimates

## Results: Clinical data

-   11 meta-analyses met criteria
-   6 side effects available for \~22 APs
-   Remaining side effects derived from guidelines

## Conclusion

<br>

::: incremental
-   Data-driven method provides a system for researchers and clinicians.

-   ID of 27 APs and 42 receptors that map well to pharmacology and clinical profiles.

-  Groups 1 & 4 more efficacious than 2 & 3

-  Method has potential for personalized psychiatry

## Discussion:

<br>

-   Does regrouping APs have an impact on our work?

-   Can we use the correlation matrix normalized for pKi D2 instead of DDD equivalencies?

-   Can we take genes associated with predicted side effects and check DNAm & gene expression profiles?
