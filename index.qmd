## Background for new classification system

::: incremental

-   Bridge the gap between clinical and research domains 
-   Improve treatment response/tolerability when a medication switch is necessary 
-   Clarify oversimplification (typical/atypical, 1st vs 2nd gen.)

## Method: Research-focused data

### Step 1: <br> Determine AP receptor affinities 

<br/>

::: incremental

-   Receptor affinities obtained from NIMH.
-   Include receptor if data were available for ≤ 5 separate drugs.
-   Include AP if data were available for ≤ 5 separate receptors.
-   Remove receptors if Ki values were identical for all drugs.
-   Convert Ki to pKi values.

### Step 2: <br> Cluster APs by receptor affinities 

<br>

::: incremental

-   Adjust pKi values for agonists/partial agonists. 
-   Create correlation matrix with adjusted pKi values.
-   Group AP with similar receptor profiles into distinct groups.

### Step 3: <br> Characterize relationships between <br> receptor profiles, other categorisation systems, and clinical effects

<br>

::: incremental

-   Performed Probabilistic PCA of receptor profiles. 
-   Calculated mean contribution of each AP cluster to 3 PCs.
-   Compare the ability of these clusters to predict side effects using ML.
-   Compare results to existing methods of categorizing APs including NbN [@Zohar.etal2015].
-   Evaluated median absolute error for 27 APs.

## Conclusion

<br>

::: incremental

-  Data driven method provides a system for researchers and clinicians. 

-  ID of 4 groups of 42 receptors and 27 APs that map well to clinical profiles.

-  Method has potential for personalized psychiatry <br>
    *predicting side effects* 
    *groups 1 & 4 more efficacious than 2 & 3*

## Discussion: 

<br> 

- Does regrouping APs have an impact on our work?

- Can we use the correlation matrix normalized for pKi D2 instead of chloropromazine equivalencies? 

- What caught your interest?
