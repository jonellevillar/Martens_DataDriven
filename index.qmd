## Method: Research-focused data

### Step 1: <br> Determine AP receptor affinities 

<br/>

::: incremental
-   Search literature for AP receptor affinities.
-   Include receptor if data were available for ≤ 5 separate drugs.
-   Include AP if data were available for ≤ 5 separate receptors.
-   Remove receptors if Ki values were identical for all drugs.

### Step 2: <br> Cluster APs by receptor affinities 

<br>

::: incremental
-   Cluster AP into groups based on similar receptor profiles
-   Convert Ki values to pKi values and adjust for drugs that are agonists or partial agonists at a given receptor
-   Create correlation matrix with adjusted pKi values\
-   Group AP with similar receptor profiles into distinct groups

### Step 3: <br> Characterize relationships  

<br>

::: incremental
-   Characterize the receptor-defined clusters by receptor affinities and clinical profiles.
-   Compare the ability of these clusters to predict side effects.
-   Compare results to existing methods of categorising APs.

## Conclusion

Groups 1 and 4 were more efficacious than clusters 2 and 3. The novel classification was superior to existing approaches when predicting side effects

Conclusions: A receptor affinity-based grouping not only reflects compound pharmacology but also detects meaningful clinical differences to a greater extent than existing approaches. The approach has the potential to benefit both patients and researchers by guiding treatment and informing drug development.

## Discussion: <br> 

- Does regrouping APs have an impact on our work?

- Can we use the correlation matrix normalized for pKi D2 instead of chloropromazine equivalencies? 

- What caught your interest?
