## Background

-   What was the need?
-   What did they hope to achieve?

## Method

- Collect data that addressed the research and clinical needs of 
- Database of side effects

## Research-focused data

## Step 1: <br> Determine AP receptor affinities 

<br/>

::: incremental
-   Search literature for AP receptor affinities.
-   Include receptor if data were available for ≤ 5 separate drugs.
-   Include AP if data were available for ≤ 5 separate receptors.
-   Remove receptors if Ki values were identical for all drugs.

## Step 2: <br> Cluster APs by receptor affinities 

<br>

::: incremental
-   Cluster AP into groups based on similar receptor profiles
-   Convert Ki values to pKi values and adjust for drugs that are agonists or partial agonists at a given receptor
-   Create correlation matrix with adjusted pKi values\
-   Group AP with similar receptor profiles into distinct groups

## Step 3: <br> Characterize relationships  

<br>

::: incremental
-   Characterize the receptor-defined clusters by receptor affinities and clinical profiles.
-   Compare the ability of these clusters to predict side effects.
-   Compare results to existing methods of categorising APs.

## Clinical-focused data

- Created a database of side effects described in . 
- Key words:

Martens Group

## Group 1

<br>

<br>

Muscarinic (M3-M5) receptor antagonism. Cholinergic and metabolic side effects.

## Group 2

<br>

<br>

Dopamine (D2) partial agonism and adrenergic antagonism. Globally low side effect burden.

::: footer
Martens Group 
:::

## Group 3

<br>

<br>

Serotonergic and dopaminergic antagonism. Globally moderate side effect burden.

Martens Group 
:::

## Group 4

<br>

<br>

Dopaminergic antagonism; Extrapyramidal and motor side effects.

## Conclusion

Groups 1 and 4 were more efficacious than clusters 2 and 3. The novel classification was superior to existing approaches when predicting side effects

Conclusions: A receptor affinity-based grouping not only reflects compound pharmacology but also detects meaningful clinical differences to a greater extent than existing approaches. The approach has the potential to benefit both patients and researchers by guiding treatment and informing drug development.

## Discussion: <br> 
## Does regrouping APs have an impact on our work?

- We needn´t be concerned about chloropromazine equivalencies? The correlation matrix effectively normalises for D2 pKi thereby [**accounting for the dosing differences between AP**]{style="color:#cc0000"}. 

(Has a similar effect to normalising for D2 pKi, thereby accounting for the dosing differences between AP - they cite their work - look at fig.3 [@Kaar.etal2020])

- What did they contribute to what is already known about categories of receptors?

- Did you learn anything that surprised you?
